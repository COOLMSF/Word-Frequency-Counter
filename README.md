# Word-Frequency-Counter

Program counts the frequency of words stored in a file. I created a hash table to store the words along with their frequency count. 

The hash table uses chaining and it stores nodes containing a string and integer value.

Supported hash table operations:

    - add
    - contains
    - delete
    - display most frequent
    
Main file contains code that processes input from the file and stores it in the hash table. The values with a frequency higher than 250 are printed.
